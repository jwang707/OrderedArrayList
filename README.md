# OrderedArrayList
# Breakout Room Summary
In our group, we briefly discussed
- size of the ArrayList
- how to deal with nulls
- how to set up the class
- for part two, pseudocode for the add method (First you sort the ArrayList, then for the first add method you can loop through it until you find a value that's greater than the input(or until the end)).
- For the set method, first you remove the value at the index found prior, then you call the add method that you just overrode.
- For the private helper method we loop through ArrayList then call the helper method in the add method.
